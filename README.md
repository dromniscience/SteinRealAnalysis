# Workbook of Real Analysis

## Collaberations wanted!

You may read the next few sections first for a crude understanding of this project. Here are some brief descriptions:

- Overleaf based
- Work any time
- Non-profit

Collaborators are desired to meet these requirements:
1. Good undergraduate discipline of Mathematics, especially a comprehensive training practice in elementary analysis and linear algebra.
2. (If your mother language is not English) Comfort with English writing.
3. Eagerness to share your ideas.
4. No fear of making mistakes.
5. Not thinking that my <img src="svgs/87181ad2b235919e0785dee664166921.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=45.69716744999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> writing sucks. [But you are free to roast my writing.ðŸ˜€]

I firmly hold on to my belief in writing with <img src="svgs/87181ad2b235919e0785dee664166921.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=45.69716744999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>:

> Flat is better than nested.

## What is it?
This cute little book serves as a collection of my solutions to exercises and problems in [Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration and Hilbert Spaces](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691113869/real-analysis) by Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi. It is still *in progress* and the current work covered the first four chapters:

- Ch1: Measure Theory
- Ch2: Integration Theory
- Ch3: Differentiation and Integration
- Ch4: Hilbert Spaces: An Introduction

My plan is to cover 

- Ch6: Abstract measure and Integration Thoery
- Ch7: Hausdroff Measure and Fractals

## How to use it?
Unless otherwise noted, the solutions in this book are the fruits of independent effort. If you are a student enrolled in a class whose textbook is exactly this one, please do not plagiarize any content from this book as your homework. If you are an amateur of solving puzzles and read this book purely for fun, you are suggested to seek its help after giving the conundrum a third shot at least.

## Organization of the book
Each chapter is divided into three sections, namely exercises, problems and supplementaries (optional). Presented in supplementaries are auxiliary materials that can better understanding of other content in the textbook.

My schedule is usually crammed, unfortunately, so I make my best effort not to dull my minds with typing answers to those easy and warm-up exercises. For the rest of them, I try my best to answer. If the problem you are looking for is missing, three possible cases can be identified:
- I decided not to include it, because either the hint in the book reveals virtually all the stories, or it is simple and is not in connection with further problems.
- I have not worked it out either.
- I may type a solution soon.


## Disclaimer
Though I think to myself that I am into preciseness and rigor when it comes to mathematics, I do not mean that every single proof presented in this little book is correct and the most elegant possible. In fact, they are just highly likely to be correct but are unlikely to be the most enlightening.

## Error Report
If you find errors, please please do report it. A BIG THANK to U in advance! ðŸ¥°

You may report a grammar mistake, a typo, a misformat or the incorrectness of a proof (~~Sincerely hope this is not the case ðŸ¥º~~). You can send email either to dr_abc@pku.edu.cn or dromniscience@gmail.com and I will reply as early as possible. Please do not send me messages over Github since I am likely to miss it. Thank you for your understanding!
